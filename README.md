# Lab: 11 - Spring for Full-Stack Web Apps
###Building Full-Stack Web Apps
1. Ensure that you can run the Spring app.
2. Create a hello world route at /hello, and ensure that you can visit that route in your browser and see a rendered template come back.
3. Create a route that turns words into UPPER CASE. For instance, I should be able to visit /capitalize/hello and get back an HTML page containing the response HELLO, or I could visit /capitalize/this is Kinda Capitalized and get an HTML page containing the response THIS IS KINDA CAPITALIZED.
4. Create a basic splash page for the Songr app, available at the root route, and style it appropriately with CSS.
5. Create an Album class to act as a model in our app.
   An Album has a title, an artist, a songCount, a length (in seconds), and an imageUrl that is a link to that album’s art.
6. Create a route at /albums that shows three album instances. (These will be hardcoded for today’s lab; create an array that contains three albums, and then display those three on the page.)



# Lab: 12 - Spring and REST


### Spring RESTful Routing


Update your Album model so that it can be saved in a database.
An Album has a title, an artist, a songCount, a length (in seconds), and an imageUrl that is a link to that album’s art.
A user should be able to see information about all the albums on the site.
A user should be able to add albums to the site.


# Lab: 13 - Related Resources and Integration Testing

Create a Song model.
A Song has a title, a length (in seconds), a trackNumber, and the album on which that song appears.
Ensure that the relationship between Albums and Songs is appropriately set up.
